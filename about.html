            “Mugshot Maven,” aka Meghan Hartung, is an avid traveler, photographer, and connoisseur of great beers. Her Instagram page showcases artistic images of beer and breweries, and was started in 2017 to document her journey into the photography, craft beer, and homebrewing world. While the Instagram page began as a hobby and creative outlet combining Meghan’s passions (beer, photography, and travel), it quickly grew into much more.

            Her work has been featured on social media channels of numerous breweries in Nebraska, Colorado, California, and many others.
            The Instagram account led Meghan to more professional photography work, taking pictures for Brickway Brewing and Distillery and Vis Major Brewing Company in Omaha, NE. She also does occasional portrait photography under the banner of Meghan Hartung Photography.

            While she took a break from both beer and photography in 2020 due to COVID-19 and pregnancy, she is excited to get back into regular posting again when things finally quiet down a bit.
            Meghan lives in Omaha, NE with her husband, son, and two cats (River and Serenity). She works full-time as a certified medical coder at a local hospital. After honeymooning in Scotland, Meghan was afflicted with a terrible wanderlust, and eagerly awaits her next international trip. Unfortunately – a planned trip to Oktoberfest 2020 in Munich was cancelled due to the global pandemic, but she is already plotting her triumphant return to traveling as soon as possible.
